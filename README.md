# 🧠 Customer Support Brain (n8n Workflow)

A multi-product AI Support Agent powered by **n8n** and **GPT-4o-mini**. This workflow uses a **Router-Solver architecture** to intelligently classify incoming queries before generating product-specific responses.

## 🚀 Features
a
* **Multi-Product Support:** Handles queries for three distinct SaaS products:
    * **Bullet:** Document/writing automation.
    * **Focuzed:** Productivity and task planning.
    * **BunnyDesk:** Time tracking and work logs.
* **Intelligent Routing:** Analyzes user intent (Setup, Bug, How-to, Pricing) and Product context before formulating a reply.
* **Context Awareness:** Maintains a conversation memory (Window Buffer) for natural follow-up questions.
* **Structured Output:** Returns clean JSON responses with escalation flag (`needsEscalation: true/false`).

## 🛠️ Architecture

The workflow follows a linear "Pipeline" pattern with two distinct AI Agents:

1.  **Normalization Layer:**
    * Cleans chat input, extracts email addresses (Regex), and standardizes session IDs.
2.  **Router Agent (Classifier):**
    * Analyzes the message to detect **Product** and **Intent**.
    * Outputs a confidence score.
3.  **Support Agent (Solver):**
    * Takes the Classification + Original Message.
    * Consults product-specific system prompts.
    * Generates the final reply.
